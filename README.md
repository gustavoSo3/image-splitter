# Image Splitter
I have a MacOS multiple desktop setup making a little harder to set a desktop background on a spam configuration as you would do in Windows. So I decided to make a simple scrip to split any image into the desire amount of "screens".

## How to use

You will need [Python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) install.

Make sure you have the [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) library install so you can run this script.

You can follow [their tutorial](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) in how to install it.


Then you can run the script using:

```bash
python3 image_splitter.py [-p PATH_TO_FILE]
```
You can also use:
```bash
python3 image_splitter.py help
```
or
```bash
python3 image_splitter.py -h
```
for a list of command arguments you can add, such as change the number of horizontal or vertical zones.

### To Add:
- [] Relative path flag.  
- [] Add error and exceptions handlers.

I take any suggestions for improvement.
